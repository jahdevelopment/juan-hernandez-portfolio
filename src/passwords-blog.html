              In the digital world, people usually have a huge number of
              services and the way to access those is through login to a
              personal account with certain personal information and a unique
              key or password; but, this system of user recognition is in the
              reality the weakest link of the chain of security due to regular
              users do not have a proper password system to maintain their
              accounts free of malicious intends.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are now multiple efforts to change the control access like
              biometrics mechanisms of fingerprints or facial recognition, but
              at the moment they are not easily accessible to all users,
              therefore we are still depending on passwords.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below, you will have some recommendations to improve your
              expertise in password management, no matter if you are an
              occasional user or a professional depending on any software
              interface to develop your daily tasks.
            </p>

              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  First of all, is important to know that a password never has
                  to have personal names, dates of birth, pets' names,
                  addresses, phone numbers, repeated characters, series of
                  characters, e.g., 123456, or any other element easy to guess
                  for others.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  Design your passwords with more than 8 characters (in this
                  case more is better), combining lowercase and uppercase
                  letters, include as well more than one number and at least one
                  special character, e.g., #,$,%,&,/,(,),=. Note: do not use <
                  or > signs, both can cause problems with web browsers.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  Try to not write your password in any digital file, nor write
                  it down on paper, make the way to remember it forever.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  Do not share the password with another person, always there
                  are people or your entire trust, but you do not know if this
                  person is aware of having good password management.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  Change your password regularly, at least twice a year, or
                  change it when you have a suspicious anyone knows it. Do not
                  use the same password to access all services, be aware of
                  using passwords in apps you do not know trust.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  ever access important accounts, e.g., bank accounts, while you
                  are connected in public wifi or you are using a lending
                  device, like an internet cafe.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  If the system allows, implement mechanisms to make stronger
                  your access, like two-factor authentication, to maintain a
                  stronger level of security to verify the entrance of your
                  accounts.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">
                <p>
                  This process depends on another factor like a token generator
                  or another device to verify identities.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="article-list">

                  And last but not least advice indeed is the most important
              recommendation is the use of passwords manager applications, which
              enhances a better experience for users who have to remember a
              bunch of passwords.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A password manager is a vault for storing all our access
              mechanisms (user and id) and controlling them with just one master
              password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of them have the option to auto-generate very strong and long
              passwords with the goal of not giving personal access keys to
              accounts that do not seem trustable.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also multiple types of password manager services, some
              of them are free or included in your web browser, others are
              extensions of your antivirus software or VPN software, and others
              paid services can offer special features like multi-platform
              access, number of users, number of passwords they can store, and
              more.
