            <p>
              Would you like to learn how to cook and eat Colombian meals for an entire day? If yes, this is the right lecture, come on and follow my steps!
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, it is important to clarify that Colombian food is rich in the next ingredients:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="article-list">Carbohydrates</li>
              <li class="article-list">Gluten</li>
              <li class="article-list">Meat</li>
              <li class="article-list">Chicken</li>
              <li class="article-list">Pork</li>
              <li class="article-list">Milk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Having in mind the last information, if you do not have problems with any of those, you could try making any of the next recipes and learn a little bit about our culture.
            </p>
            <p>One of the positive points of the pandemic is that more people took advantage of their spare time at home to learn something new, I did that with the kitchen and made the purpose to learn to cook different dishes for my family, and I enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>Now I will share with you one of my new hobbies, giving simple examples of three meals of a regular Colombian family, with ingredients easy to find in any supermarket and quantities for cooking for three people.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="article-list">Start with breakfast to start a day with a recharge of energy.</li>
              <li class="article-list">Continue with lunch which is the main meal of the day.</li>
              <li class="article-list">Finalize the dinner and you are ready to go with a full stomach but a happy heart.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <ol>
                <p><strong><i>Breakfast: </i></strong>Orange juice, hot chocolate with cloves and cinnamon, scrambled ranch eggs.</p>
