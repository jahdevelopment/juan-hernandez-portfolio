            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>
              "Hypertext Text Markup Language", commonly known as HTML, is the
              language created to represent the structure of websites; in other
              words, this is the skeleton of the apps. All the elements that
              compound a web page are implied in the content of this language.
              In each one of them, there is a way to represent the
              characteristics that connect the structure with other
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every person interested in learning web design should start with
              HTML, it is easy to understand due to its simplicity, and helps
              the user to organize an ordered sequence of the elements.
            </p>
            <h5><i>HTML Tag</i></h5>
            <p>
              Tag is the mechanism to represent the existence of any element of the website. This is represented by two double brackets like this:
            </p>
            <img class="code-images" src="images/tag-code.png" alt="tags with anything inside">
            <p>
              Into the angle brackets, there is the space to put the sign of each element represented by a letter, some letters, or a word. The first pair of angle brackets (without / sign) represents the opening of some content, and the second pair (with the “/”) shows us the finalization of the element.
            </p>
            <h5><i>HTML Element</i></h5>
            <p>
              An element is one characteristic content in the structure of the HTML, represented by the tags, its name of it and other details that represent its functionality.
            </p>
            <h5><i>HTML Atribute</i></h5>
            <p>
              The attribute is the detail of the functionality of each element; also the attribute has the facility of being represented in different ways like id, class, type, colour, etc. Through this, the element could be connected with other languages with the objective of dynamizing its characteristics.
            </p>
            <h5><i>Inline Element</i></h5>
            <p>
              The inline element is one type of HTML code which represent a new characteristic just for a small part of a whole line code. Example:
              </p>
              <img class="code-images" src="images/inline-element.png" alt="a block of code showing an inline element">
              <p>In the example above,</p>
              <img class="code-images" src="images/span-code.png" alt="span tags opening and closing the code">
              <p>is the inline element.</p> 
            </p>
            <h5><i>Block Element</i></h5>
            <p>
              This is the other type of element, instead of inline elements that do not start a new line of code, the block element represents a new and complete line of code. When the browsers recognize the block elements, automatically open spaces before and after to separate the existence of a new element. Example:
            </p>
              <img class="code-images" src="images/block-emelemt.png" alt="a complete line of code without inlines elements">
              <p>In the example above</p>
              <img class="code-images" src="images/p-tag-code.png" alt="paragraph tag opening and closing code">
              <p>
                is the element that represents a paragraph, and takes its own space.
              </p>
            </p>
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <h5><i>Would you like to know what exactly CSS is?</i></h5>
            <p>
              A webpage written with just HTML is a standard format site; “Cascading Styling Sheets” is the code implemented to specify the style properties of the elements present in an HTML. You can configure some basic characteristics like the font type, colours, backgrounds, margins, and more, even is possible to create animations, all depending on your skills as a designer. Example:
              </p>
              <img class="code-images" src="images/css-example.png" alt="example of css code rules">
              <p>
              In the example above we are specifying three new characteristics of styling for the font of a paragraph.
            </p>
            <h5><i>CSS Rule</i></h5>
            <p>
              A CSS rule has exactly represented on the block of code written in the last example, this is the syntaxis of CSS. It contains two characteristics. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The first characteristic is the Selector which indicates the name of the HTML element whose CSS properties are going to be applied. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The second characteristic is the list of values or CSS properties. Could be one or more values.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the example above, the selector is the letter p, and the values are the 3 properties in the brackets.
            </p>
