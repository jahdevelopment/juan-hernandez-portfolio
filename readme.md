# README

## Project Name
Juan Alberto Hernandez - Personal Portfolio.

## Description
The main objective of this web page is to compile some of the technologies the author has learned as a software developer student. The design is an original creation, starting from scratch without using any template, boilerplate or framework. 

Initially, the portfolio tries to achieve the objectives of two different assignments of the academic program. Later on, as the author masters more technologies, these will be included in the web page to convert it into the presentation card of the candidate for possible job offers.

The first version was focused on showing results of the structure and style of the web page. Also, included tools that facilities to handle the project as an entire repository.  

In the second version, the portfolio improves more interactive and modern styles, resolves styles problems and includes the final content of the sections like the texts and photos on the _About Me_ page and _Blog_ page.
