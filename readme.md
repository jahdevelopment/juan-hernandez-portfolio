## Project Name
Juan Alberto Hernandez - Personal Portfolio.

## Description
This is the first version of my personal portfolio created as a final Assignment for the class SD-130 in the program of software Developer in MITT.

The main objective of this web page is to show some of the projects I have been trained on at the moment. But, at first sight, we are just focused on the process of the automation of all the tools into the develop of the project. In future versions, we are planning to convert all the portfolio in a more interactive and modern version.

## Components
The website has a main page which is called Home, inside of this you can find at first sight a minimalize presentation, next there is a brief review of the next pages. 

- The first page is called "Projects". This section shows 3 different projects developed by me as a process of training of the "frontEnd Development"; all of them have been written with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The second page is called "About Me". There is a small biography of the projectÂ´s author. Includes an automatic slider of personal images.
- The third page is called "Contact Me". Where there is a simple contact form that is not functionally at the moment.
- The fourth page is called "Blog". It will be a small portal of articles related to the world of IT. At the moment is just the template of the section.

Finally, the project drives the same template of colours, boundaries, margins fonts, buttons, weight, etc. and they are going to be present in the body and styling of the main page and its dependants. The code of this project is written by the author without online templates or boilerplates.

The project is version controlled by commits and it is being conected as a repository of gitHub. The URL is: https://github.com/juanhernandezdeveloper/juan-hernandez-portfolio.git
